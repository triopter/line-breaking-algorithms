Via https://xxyxyz.org/line-breaking/:

One additional option is to replace the preceding [total_monotonicity.py] 
SMAWK routine and its fairly large constant factor by a simple divide & conquer 
monotone matrix search. The complexity will drop back to O(n * log n) but for 
smaller problem instances it may actually run faster than the asymptotically 
superior approach.
